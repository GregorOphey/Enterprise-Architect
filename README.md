# Enterprise-Architect
scripts and other code snippets to extend Sparxs Enterprise Architect


I forked this from here: https://github.com/gobravedave/Enterprise-Architect

and adapt as needed for personal use.

Mainly plantUML parsing needs adapting, since original author wrote for his personal plantUML style and nothing else (which is OK!). I found this via his blog https://modelhelper.home.blog/2019/03/10/create-a-sequence-diagram-using-plantuml/
