# Enterprise-Architect
scripts and other code snippets to extend Sparxs Enterprise Architect


I forked this from here: https://github.com/gobravedave/Enterprise-Architect

and adapt as needed for personal use.

Mainly plantUML parsing needs adapting, since original author wrote for his personal plantUML style and nothing else (which is OK!). I found this via his blog https://modelhelper.home.blog/2019/03/10/create-a-sequence-diagram-using-plantuml/

## Some notes to myself 

(since I am a total VBS newbie ...)

1. log level can be set at the top of the Create ... script

2. need to copy this to EA for testing ... how to automate?
